## Study info

The SOEP-K2ID project aims at     
* investigating effects of ECEC quality on children’s socio-emotional development,    
* examining socio-economic selectivity in parental choices of ECEC quality,     
* assessing information asymmetries between mothers and ECEC providers,      
* exploring how ECEC quality affects maternal employment and wellbeing and indirectly child development.     

The three-year project launched in September 2013 is funded by the Jacobs Foundation. The project collected new data on the quality of ECEC institutions, that children below school age in Socio-Economic Panel Study attend. In a first step, the project surveyed parents of all SOEP children below school age to investigate the parental decision-making process and subjective evaluations with respect to ECEC quality of the institutions attended by their children. In a second step, the project collected indicators of structural, orientation and process quality from directors and class teachers of the ECEC institutions to capture the quality of interactions between children and teaching staff, activities, learning environment, and teacher orientations. By combining institutional information on the educational context with individual and household data collected in the SOEP, this new data set will allow researchers to examine associations with children’s development first during early childhood and school years and subsequently until adulthood.

## Method

Target sample: all children under school age living in a SOEP household in 2013 (2014 for SOEP-M sample).

Instruments: 
* PAPI questionnaires sent to parents of all SOEP children under school from November 2013    
 (except SOEP-M Sample)
* PAPI questionnaires sent to all directors and group educators of ECEC institutions attended by the SOEP    
  children from February 2014 (where address and consent were provided by parents)
* PAPI Questionnaires sent to SOEP-M sample parents from November 2014
* PAPI Questionnaires sent to SOEP-M sample ECEC institutions from February 2015

## Data access

Data will be made available to all SOEP-Users after completion of the project. The exact date is to be decided. For further information on data access or possibilities for collaborations, please contact     Pia Schober (pschober@diw.de).
